In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can occur when using AsyncStorage. If you attempt to store a value that is not a string, it can lead to unexpected behavior, silent failures, or crashes. AsyncStorage is designed to handle strings; attempting to store other data types, like objects or numbers, directly results in type errors or data corruption. This is easily missed during development because there is not always a clear error message. Instead, the application may behave erratically or data may fail to load.
