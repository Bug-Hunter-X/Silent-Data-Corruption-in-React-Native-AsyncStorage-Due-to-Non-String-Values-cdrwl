This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, bug in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage.  The bug occurs when attempting to store non-string values in AsyncStorage, leading to unpredictable results. The solution provides a robust method for handling various data types by stringifying values before storage and parsing them upon retrieval.
